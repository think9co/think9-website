                >At the heart of entrepreneurship is creation of a business out
                of an idea and an opportunity and setting it in motion.
                Entrepreneurship is about being able to adapt, take risks, and
                constantly innovate. True entrepreneurship is not just about
                starting a business; it's a way of thinking and approaching
                life." - Kishore Biyani</span

              The qualities of Co-founder may vary depending on the specific

              common qualities that are sought include
              <br /><br />
              <span class="yellow-bg">Entrepreneurial Experience:</span> The

              resourceful and finding creative solutions to complex challenges
              by quickly identifying bottlenecks, being able to tap into their

            <p>
              <span class="yellow-bg"

                business.

            </p>

            <h2>WHAT’S IN IT FOR THE CO-FOUNDER?</h2>
            <p>
              The ideal Co-Founder is someone who has created a new
              consumer-facing business - as an entrepreneur, co-founder or a
              member of the founding team - that crossed monthly revenues of Rs
              1 crore. She/he may have even raised pre-seed/seed capital from a
              family office or angel investors, built a start-up on their own
              and are now looking for a second journey with a larger outcome.
              <br /><br />
              Access to the Think9 founders and the ecosystem will save time,
              energy and effort that goes into building any venture from
              scratch. Think9 will further support the Co-Founder with the
              following deliverables:
              <br /><br />
              <span class="yellow-bg">Compensation:</span> Co-Founders will be
              eligible for a sustenance pay of around Rs 5 lakhs per month and
              option to further convert this into equity at par valuation.
              <br /><br />
              <span class="yellow-bg">Seed Funding to the Venture:</span> Think9
              and/or its affiliates will provide Rs 5 crore of seed funding in
              the entity to cover for pre-opex costs of the Venture and for
              business operations for the first few months after its launch. The
              Co-Founder can raise an additional Rs 5 crore from external
              sources at a minimum pre-money valuation of Rs 30 crore.
              <br /><br />
              <span class="yellow-bg">Equity for Co-Founders:</span> Co-Founders
              will be granted shares equivalent to 20% stake in the Venture.
              These shares will be locked-in with a reverse vesting. The
              Co-Founder will be eligible to get 10% stake at the end of 2 years
              of their engagement. The remaining 10% stake will be un-locked at
              the end of 4 years or when the Venture raises equity capital at a
              minimum pre-money valuation of $10 million / Rs 80 crore,
              whichever is earlier. <br /><br />
